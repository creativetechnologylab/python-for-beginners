# Getting Started

## Creating a Python File

We can make a simple Python program to do some maths for us. Start by opening a folder in VS Code.

Now, using either Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac), create a folder named "python-exercises." Make sure the folder is in a location that is easy to remember. Now open the folder and click "Select Folder".

Now we can see that this folder has been opened with VS Code. Click on the "New File" icon to create a new file within the folder.

Name this file "calculator.py". By giving it the `.py` extention, VS Code knows to treat it as a Python file. This will cause the new file to then open in the editor area.
