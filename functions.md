# Functions

Functions are small, reusable chunks of code that allow us to repeat a specific task. You can think of functions as being a bit like the programming equivalent of a recipe in which we have ingredients (our function inputs), a set of steps for preparing the food (a function _body_), and a finished dish (our program output).

The "ingredients" given to a function are often called its _parameters_ or its _arguments_. Later, we will see that some functions do not actually take inputs or give back outputs, but that does not prevent them from being useful in certain situations.
